This endpoint allows you to create a new Text to 3D Refine task.

Parameters
Required attributes
Name
mode
Type
string
Description
This field should be set to "refine" when creating a refine task.

Name
preview_task_id
Type
string
Description
The corresponding preview task id.

The status of the given preview task must be SUCCEEDED.

Optional attributes
Name
enable_pbr
Type
boolean
Description
Generate PBR Maps (metallic, roughness, normal) in addition to the base color.

Default to false if not specified.

Note that enable_pbr should be set to false when using Sculpture style, as Sculpture style generates its own set of PBR maps.

Name
texture_prompt
Type
string
Description
Provide an additional text prompt to guide the texturing process. Maximum 600 characters.

Name
texture_image_url
Type
string
Description
Provide a 2d image to guide the texturing process. We currently support .jpg, .jpeg, and .png formats.

There are two ways to provide the image:

Publicly accessible URL: A URL that is accessible from the public internet
Data URI: A base64-encoded data URI of the image. Example of a data URI: data:image/jpeg;base64,<your base64-encoded image data>
Image texturing may not work optimally if there are substantial geometry differences between the original asset and uploaded image. Only one of texture_image_url or texture_prompt may be used to guide the texturing process. If both parameters are provided, then texture_prompt will be used to texture the model by default. Texturing via either text or image will cost 10 credits per task.

Name
ai_model
Type
string
Description
ID of the model to use for refining.

Available values:

meshy-5
meshy-4
Default to meshy-5 if not specified.

This parameter is only applicable when the corresponding preview task was generated with meshy-5. If the preview task used meshy-4, this parameter is invalid.

Name
moderation
Type
boolean
Description
When set to true, the input content will automatically be screened for potentially harmful content. If harmful content is detected, the task will not proceed to generation.

Both the text from texture_prompt and the image from texture_image_url will be screened.

Defaults to false if not specified.

Returns
The result property of the response contains the task id of the newly created Text to 3D task.
